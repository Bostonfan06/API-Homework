# API-Homework

-I created an array of animals that are displayed up top. You can click on one of those buttons to display 10 different gifs.

-You can also add your own animal by entering a new animal in the input box, then submit it. Once submitted, it will add a new button to the top of page. Click that button to display your current results.

-Click on the any Giphy to see it in action. If you want the giphy to stop, click on it again. Hope you enjoy the project. It was a challenge.
